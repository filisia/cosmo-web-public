```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmo-web-public.git
cd cosmo-web-public

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

## üîß Configuration

The application uses a runtime configuration file (`public/config.js`) that can be updated without rebuilding:

```javascript
window.COSMO_CONFIG = {
  wsUrl: 'ws://localhost:8080',  // WebSocket server URL
  debug: false,
  reconnectAttempts: 5,
  reconnectDelay: 1000
};
```

## üåê Deployment

This application is deployed on Vercel at [https://cosmo-bridge.vercel.app](https://cosmo-bridge.vercel.app).

### Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_WS_URL` - WebSocket server URL for production

## üîó Connecting to Cosmo Bridge

1. **Start your local Cosmo Bridge server** on port 8080
2. **Open the web application** at [https://cosmo-bridge.vercel.app](https://cosmo-bridge.vercel.app)
3. **The app will automatically connect** to `ws://localhost:8080`
4. **Use the device discovery** to find and connect to Cosmo robots

### Important Notes:
- Each user needs their own local Cosmo Bridge server running
- The web app connects to `localhost:8080` on the user's machine
- No server-side WebSocket proxy is needed

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended for Web Bluetooth)
